Assessment Background/Scenario

A construction company requires an application to efficiently manage its
 projects and employee assignments. The company undertakes multiple construction
 projects, each requiring a team of workers with specific roles. The application
  should enable users to input and store project data, assign employees to projects
  along with their roles, and perform essential operations such as tracking project
  costs, sorting employee and project data, and retrieving key project details for
  effective management.
Project data includes Project ID, Project Name, Project Description,
Project Cost, Start Date, and End Date as shown in Table 1.
Employee data in Table 2 includes Employee ID, First Name, Last Name,
Department, and Role. The application should store this data in an appropriate
 internal structure.

 Design and build a console-based application that requires the user to input
 the project and employee data via the console/command line and store it in an
  appropriate internal structure. There is no requirement for this data to be
   preserved after the application is closed. You will need to consider what
   the application outputs to the user to demonstrate the results of each task below.
   You should provide the user with a means to close the program once operations are
   complete.

Assignment Tasks

Your application should be able to perform the following tasks given the scenario above:
Task A: Write pseudocode algorithms for the following tasks given below.
1) Take as input, the project data (Project ID, Project Name, Project Description,
Project Cost,  Start Date, and End Date) and store it in an appropriate data structure.
The Project ID should be auto-incremental.
2) Take as input, the employee data (Employee ID, First Name, Last Name, Department,
 and Role) and store it in an appropriate data structure. The Employee ID should be
  auto-incremental.
3) Count the total number of projects and calculate their combined cost based on the
projects’ data as shown in Table 3.

Total Projects	Combined total cost
            6	          £16200000

4) Search and display the project based on the highest project cost as shown in Table 4.

Project ID	Project Name	Project Cost
C104	Bridge Construction	£ 4400000

5) Search and display the project based on the lowest project cost as shown in Table 5.

Project ID	Project Name	Project Cost
C103	Commercial Plaza	£ 1400000

6) Sort all employee’s data  alphabetically by  last name, as shown in Table 6.
   Table 6: Sample Employees' Data, sorted alphabetically by last name.

   Employee ID	First Name	Last Name	Department	Role
   E406	Olivia	Brown	Site Operations	Construction Site Supervisor
   E401	Michael	Johnson	Civil Engineering	Structural Engineer
   E404	Sophia	Martinez	Safety & Compliance	Safety Officer
   E402	Anna	Rodriguez	Architecture	Architect
   E403	James	Thompson	Project Management	Project Manager
   E405	David	Wilson	Electrical Engineering	Electrical Engineer

7) Sort all Project’s data  by project  cost (highest cost first), as shown in Table 7.

Table 7: Sample Projects’ Data-highest cost first
Project ID	Project Name	Project Description	Project Cost	Start Date	End Date
C104	Bridge Construction	Building a new suspension bridge over the river	£ 4400000	05/10/2023	10/08/2025
C106	Airport Terminal Upgrade	Renovation and expansion of the airport terminal	£ 3900000	10/12/2023	31/07/2025
C102	Highway Expansion	Expanding a major highway to improve traffic flow	£ 2400000	01/08/2023	30/06/2025
C105	Industrial Warehouse	Constructing a warehouse for storage and distribution	£ 2100000	20/11/2023	30/09/2024
C101	Residential Tower	Construction of a 25-story residential building	£ 2000000	10/07/2023	15/12/2024
C103	Commercial Plaza	Developing a shopping and office complex	£ 1400000	15/09/2023	20/05/2024

8) Take user input for Project ID, Employee ID, and Role,
then assign the employee to the specified project with the given role as shown in Table 8.
   Sample: user input
   "Enter the Project ID: C103
   Enter the Employee ID: E405
   Enter the Role: Electrical Engineer"

Table 8: Sample Projects’ Data—employee assigned to the project
   "Project ID	Project Name	Employee ID	Role	First Name	Last Name
   C103	Commercial Plaza	E405	Electrical Engineer	David	Wilson
   "


Task B: Construct the application and implement algorithms.
Develop a single Java program that enables the user to store, search, and
manage project and employee data
by using algorithms studied in this module, which are run from the command line.
The application should be a
text-based, menu-driven system with a console menu.

Implement all the algorithms you have created for Task A.
Note:
You need to ensure that the user input is validated, and feedback is given when
 an invalid input is entered.
Test all the implemented algorithms you have created for Task A.

Exam:
1) The exam will take new data on exam day.
Questions for that (could be different on exam day)
- State how it would respond, if errors are generated (which algo generates it)

2) Discuss how you would change your program effectively
and how to communicate the error to the user
- Prepare error handling basics. In the exam, explain changes for the
particular edge case

3) Discuss how you would test for the error and handle it
- Priorities would be around ensuring the program doesn't
stop, or avoiding stack overflows and memory overuse

4) Demonstrate the use of decomposition of a problem
best practice in code reuse
OOP
In relation to one of the requirements of the project

5) Upload the code in a pdf/jpg or png that demonstrates
question 4 part 1

6) Design an algo that fulfills a new task specified
in the exam. Show which algos you are reusing.
